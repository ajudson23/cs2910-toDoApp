1. What you enjoyed about using the chosen framework

I choose to learn the React framework during this adventure. The only framework I have had experience with thus far was Django where I utilized CSS, HTML, & Python during that time. Some key components that I enjoyed about this framework was it doesn’t enforce strict rules about coding conventions & organization. Since my past experience with python, indenting is key, and following a strict layout is important otherwise you get errors. However with this framework it felt extremely relaxed with this. My react app seemed a lot more simplistic which was cool. Another component that I haven’t had any experience with until now was JSX. It was super interesting writing files in “.js” that had my html & javascript written together. I just appreciated the organization & readability of this. Another unique component that I just haven’t ever incorporated was the “export” statements. It was interesting that you could code export statements at the bottom of the files & they would be able to be reached throughout the environment through import statements. From my reading, a core concept of React is minimizing common bugs and focusing on the UI side of that. This element of the framework could be seen in index.js where we implemented “strictMode” that was in charge of facilitating this component of finding common bugs.
Another component that was extremely interesting was only the public file is seen on the web interface. You can’t see any of my javascript functions, and the majority of what you’re looking at. You can’t see the event handlers from what I could see. This could pose a benefit towards minimizing vulnerabilities.
The use of “props” was a major component of using React. It was easy to use and allowed the system to access the data that way and be rendered.

2. What you disliked
   To be completely honest, there wasn’t a whole lot that I disliked. I have experience creating a similar environment through Django Framework, so it was honestly just interesting to explore a new method to create an app. I thought the tutorial was super useful, so I definitely could see myself creating an app in the future utilizing the React framework. Not much to complain about, more just learning a new tool.

3. Something entertaining… not cats
   Snowboarding season is coming up soon! My board is all waxed and I'm ready to surf the snow.
   Also here’s the best dad joke that AI could come up with, “How do you organize a space party? – you planet”
   I know that’s kinda lame, chat gpt should try to do better next time. I agree.
